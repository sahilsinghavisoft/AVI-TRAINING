    "Today there are no certain methods by using which we can predict whether there will be rainfall today or not. Even the meteorological departmentâ€™s prediction fails sometimes. In this article, we will learn how to build a machine-learning model which can predict whether there will be rainfall today or not based on some atmospheric factors. This problem is related to Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning because machine learning models tend to perform better on the previously known task which needed highly skilled individuals to do so. \n",
